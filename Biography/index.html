       <h2> About</h2>

<p>  Gerrard was discovered by his local upper-division football club, Liverpool FC, at age nine.
     He played for Liverpool’s youth squad and signed a professional contract with them at age 17.
      His first-team debut came in 1998, and he became a regular contributor the following year.
       Gerrard had established himself as a star midfielder by the 2000–01 season</p>
       

       <p>
        Gerrard was named Liverpool’s captain in 2003, at just age 23. In the 2004–05 season he led Liverpool to the club’s first Champions League title in 21 years, scoring a key goal in Liverpool’s dramatic three-goal comeback against AC Milan in the final.
         During the following off-season he became embroiled in a high-profile contract dispute with Liverpool that nearly resulted in his transfer to Chelsea FC before he ultimately re-signed with his longtime club.

            Gerrard then helped Liverpool win both the 2005–06 FA Cup and UEFA Super Cup, and he was named the Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year at season’s end. In 2007 Liverpool advanced to the Champions League final for the second time in three years but lost to AC Milan by a score of 2–1.
             Gerrard scored a career-high 24 goals in the 2008–09 Premier League season, which netted him the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year award.

            In June 2005, Gerrard extended his contract at the club, signing a four-year deal.[29] Houllier resigned as Liverpool manager after a trophy-less 2003–04 campaign, and Gerrard was linked with a move to Chelsea during the off-season. Gerrard admitted that he was not "happy with the progress Liverpool has made", and that "for the first time in my career I've thought about the possibility of moving on."[30] Ultimately,
             Gerrard turned down a £20 million offer from Chelsea, staying with Liverpool under new coach Rafael Benítez

    Liverpool had many injuries early in the 2004–05 season, and a broken toe suffered in a September league match against Manchester United sidelined Gerrard until late November.[32] On 8 December, Gerrard scored a crucial 25-yard half volley in the 86th minute of Liverpool's final Champions League group stage match against Olympiacos to send the club through to the knockout round.
    [33] A strike that saw Sky Sports co-commentator Andy Gray exclaim, "Oh, you beauty!! What a hit son! What a hit!", Gerrard claimed that this was his most important, if not his best, goal for Liverpool to date.[34][35] However, Gerrard netted an own goal during the 2005 League Cup final on 27 February , which proved decisive in Liverpool's 3–2 loss to Chelsea after extra time at the Millennium Stadium.[
